**Project-01: COVID GLOBAL DATA EXPLORATION PROJECT**

This is a SQL portfolio project analyzing COVID-19 data from January 8th, 2020 to April 19th, 2023, sourced from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). The data is comprised of two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, containing information on confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccine doses administered by location and date.

The objective of this project is to practice data analysis using SQL queries and gain insights into COVID-19 and vaccination trends worldwide. The repository includes SQL scripts covering various aspects of data analysis, such as data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and visualization.
