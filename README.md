**Project-02: NASHVILLE HOUSING DATA CLEANING PROJECT**

Welcome to my portfolio project on data cleaning with SQL! In this project, I worked on the Nashville Housing dataset and employed various aspects of data cleaning to ensure the data is usable and reliable for analysis.

The Nashville Housing dataset is a complex and large dataset with multiple data quality issues. To address these issues, I employed various data cleaning techniques such as data profiling, data transformation, data normalization, data standardization, data enrichment, and data cleansing.

With data profiling, I was able to identify missing values, null values, and outliers in the dataset. Using data transformation, I converted the data into a more suitable format, cleaned the data, and removed unwanted data elements. Data normalization helped to eliminate data redundancy and improve data consistency while data standardization ensured that data values were consistent across different data sources.

Finally, data cleansing involved removing duplicates, fixing invalid data, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset.

Overall, this project showcases my expertise in data cleaning using SQL and my ability to apply various data cleaning techniques to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.
