This is a portfolio project in SQL that analyzes COVID-19 data from January 8th, 2020 to April 19th, 2023. The data was sourced from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and consists of two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. The CovidDeaths table contains information on the number of confirmed cases and deaths by location and date, while the CovidVaccinations table contains information on the number of vaccine doses administered by location and date.

The purpose of this project is to practice data analysis using SQL queries and to gain insights into the trends and patterns of COVID-19 and vaccination data across the world. The SQL scripts uploaded in this repository cover various aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and visualization.

Note that the data is updated frequently, so the analysis in this project may not reflect the most recent COVID-19 and vaccination trends.
