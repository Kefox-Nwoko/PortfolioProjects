This repository contains scripts of projects done in SQL and Python. 
These Projects are personal and mean so much to me as a Data Analyst. 
It is a window for me to showcase reults of my curiosity and hunger for insights of various issues begging for answers and better understanding in the world. 
And an opportunity to be part of the chain of change in the world.
Thanks to patiently follow my works. They may not be perfect but there is always something to understand in data.
